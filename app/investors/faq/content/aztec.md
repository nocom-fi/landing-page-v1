Aztec is the optimal infrastructure for private lending, offering true privacy with minimal performance compromises.

### Private Compute L2
Aztec Network is a **general purpose private compute blockchain** built as an L2 on Ethereum. Think of it as Solana or Ethereum with both **private and public state**.

### Noir ZK Language
Aztec uses the **Noir ZK language** — the best client-side proving language available, operating **an order of magnitude faster** than any other language on the market. This performance advantage makes Aztec optimal for applications seeking actual user privacy.

### Bridge Infrastructure
As an Ethereum L2, the **canonical rollup bridge** provides a safe channel for the immense concentration of L1 capital to freely flow in and out of the L2.

**Wormhole** provides ancillary bridges for:
- Solana
- Ethereum L2s
- Alt L1s

### Competitive Landscape
There isn't a viable alternative to Aztec today:
- **Aleo and Mina** fall short of the mark
- **Miden** will not launch before Aztec
- **Circuits on public chains** don't offer true privacy
- **MPC networks** are just multisigs for privacy

For all these reasons, Nocom believes Aztec is the most capable infrastructure to make private lending a reality.
