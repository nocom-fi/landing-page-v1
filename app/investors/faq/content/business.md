Nocom generates protocol revenue through four primary mechanisms:

### Liquidations
In V1, Nocom's treasury claims all liquidation incentives. Future versions will decentralize operations and share fees with trusted operators.

### Interest Fees
The protocol captures **10% of interest generated**. The remaining **90% goes to lenders**.

### Flashloan Fees
Flashloans carry a **0.1% fee**, split 50/50 between treasury and depositors:
- **0.05%** of total flashloan volume goes to treasury
- **0.05%** distributed to depositors

### Cross-Chain Fees
Nocom charges a **0.25% fee** for cross-chain loan or borrow entries.
